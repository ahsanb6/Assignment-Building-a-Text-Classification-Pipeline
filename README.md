# SMS Spam Detection

This project uses machine learning to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham**.

## Techniques Used
- Text Preprocessing (cleaning, tokenizing, lemmatizing)
- Feature Engineering (Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings)
- Model Training (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
- Evaluation using precision, recall, F1, accuracy

## Best Result
- Logistic Regression with Bag-of-Words: 98% Accuracy

## How to Run
1. Open `assignment-text-classification.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`
3. Run cells step by step
